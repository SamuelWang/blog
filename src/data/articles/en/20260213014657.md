I had heard the term “spaced repetition” before but never truly understood how it worked. Recently I wanted to improve my learning efficiency — especially for language learning and retaining professional knowledge — so I dug deeper into the topic.

**Spaced repetition** is a learning technique based on psychological principles that helps improve memory retention.

The core idea is simple: reviewing material right when you are about to forget it produces the best results. By gradually increasing the interval between reviews, you can use minimal time to transfer information from short-term to long-term memory.

## Core Theory: The Forgetting Curve

This method is built on the “forgetting curve” introduced by German psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus.

- **Forgetting is fast:** Without review, we forget most of what we learned within a few days.
- **Review resets forgetting:** Each review bout slows the rate of forgetting.
- **Best timing:** Reviewing just before you would forget forces effortful recall, a process that significantly strengthens neural connections.

## How It Works in Practice

Unlike cramming—trying to memorize a lot in a single session—spaced repetition schedules reviews based on how well you know the material:

- **First review:** 1 day after learning (short interval).
- **Second review:** If you still remember it, the next review might be in 3 days.
- **Third review:** If you still recall it, the interval might extend to 7 days.
- **Fourth review:** Then 16 days, 35 days, and so on.

**Key point:** If you forget something during a review, the interval resets or shortens so you review more frequently until the item is learned again.

## Common Uses and Tools

Because this method requires precise scheduling of review times, manual tracking is difficult — so people typically use software (SRS, Spaced Repetition Software).

**Common use cases include:**

- **Language learning:** Memorizing vocabulary and phrases (the most widespread use).
- **Medical and law exams:** Fields requiring memorization of large amounts of terminology and rules.
- **Software development:** Remembering syntax, commands, or common algorithms.

**Popular tools:**

- **Anki:** The most well-known open-source app; powerful and highly customizable.
- **SuperMemo:** The pioneer of spaced repetition algorithms.
- **Quizlet:** Friendlier interface for beginners; includes some spaced repetition features.

**Mochi**

I currently use Mochi (https://mochi.cards/). It stores learning items as cards and includes built-in spaced repetition. Each card has a “front” and a “back”; you put a prompt on the front and the answer on the back.

When you review, Mochi adjusts the next review time based on how well you recall the item. If you remember it, the interval follows the schedule; if you don’t, the interval shortens so you review it sooner — keeping you at the optimal moment for review.

Mochi’s interface is clean and easy to use, and it offers a web offline mode. Compared to Anki, I find Mochi’s UI more modern.
