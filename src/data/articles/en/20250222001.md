You may have seen code where a single component contains all the logic of the API requests and the business process. Such a component becomes quite large, and this logic tends to be repeated throughout the project.

To address these issues, we need a better architecture design to organize the files and logic of a front-end project for better maintenance.

There are many ways to organize code. One approach is to organize code by functionality, such as separating API logic from components. Another approach is to organize it by the functional modules, like posts on a blog website.

In this post, I will share how I organize the code on a Vue project with TypeScript.

## API Layer

At first, I separate API logic from components and put it into the `apis` folder. Under the apis folder, there are sub-folders of functional modules, for example, the `posts` folder.

In general, the models of APIs are usually different from the models of views. Therefore, the models of APIs can be placed in the `models` folder in every subfolder of functional modules.

## View and Component Layer

Next, by convention, the root components that the router uses will be placed under the `views` folder. The child components of view components and the common components will be placed in the `components` folder.

In the `components` folder, I categorize components by functional modules. For example, components related to posts are placed in the `posts` folder, and components for common UI elements are placed in the `ui` folder.

## Service, Composable, and Model Layers

Between the API and the view component, there is significant business logic required to process the data. I place this business logic in the `services` folder. Similarly, I categorize this logic by functional modules. I write these codes as multiple single functions. Writing the service as a single function can improve testing and maintenance.

Vue3 introduced the Composition API, which includes many custom composables. Composables can extract some common stateful logic and make it reusable. I place these composables in the `composables` folder. Within the `composables` folder, the subfolders are categorized by functional modules.

The difference between a service and a composable is that a service only processes data with business logic, while a composable contains the state of view. During development, you should extract repeated logic and states into a service and a composable as much as possible. This aligns with the DRY principle.

There are many models used by the views and components, which I place in the `models` folder and categorize deeply by functional modules.

## Store and Utility Layers

The code for state management is placed in the `store` folder. The store should only include the states that are used globally. If a state is used across two or three parent-child components, consider using a composable instead.

Utility functions can be placed in the `utils` folder. Like services, I write utility functions as individual functions for better testing and maintenance.

So far, I have shared an approach to organize a Vue project. Below is an overview of the structure I described above.

```
src/
├── apis/
│   └── posts/
│       └── models/
├── assets/
├── components/
│   ├── posts/
│   └── ui/
├── composables/
│   └── posts/
├── models/
│   └── posts/
├── routes/
├── services/
│   └── posts/
├── store/
├── styles/
├── utils/
└── views/
```
