In the age of AI, distinguishing the accuracy of information has become increasingly important. AI can generate a large amount of content, but that does not guarantee the accuracy or reliability of that content.

## The Importance of Independent Thinking

Independent thinking is the ability to analyze, evaluate, and judge information on one's own. At its core it involves iterative self-awareness and rational decision-making: not simply accepting others' views, but seeking the essence of an issue.

People often say that college graduates should have "critical thinking" skills, which are closely related to independent thinking. Today, I believe independent thinking is a basic ability everyone should possess, especially in an age of information overload.

Even before AI, society was already filled with inaccurate or biased information that required verification. The arrival of AI makes this problem more complex because AI can produce content that looks plausible but is actually incorrect — or even misleading. This makes independent thinking more important: we need to be able to tell which information is trustworthy and which may be wrong or biased. Whether information was generated by AI may be less important than our ability to assess its reliability and relevance.

## How to Cultivate Independent Thinking

Cultivating independent thinking requires ongoing practice and reflection.

- **Build a knowledge framework and separate facts from opinions:** Develop a systematic body of knowledge, strip emotion from analysis, and focus on evidence and logic to distinguish facts from opinions.
- **Use critical questioning (pre-mortem):** Play the role of the critic to find flaws in your own views, and remain skeptical of authoritative statements.
- **Broaden your perspective and think in reverse:** Step outside your echo chamber, listen to people with different backgrounds, and try arguing from opposing viewpoints.
- **Define the problem and understand motivations:** Clarify the problem itself and consider the motivations behind the viewpoints presented.
- **Quiet reflection and internal dialogue:** Spend time alone reflecting to reduce blind conformity and become the author of your own thoughts.

## Applying This to AI-Generated Content

When evaluating AI-generated content, independent thinking helps you judge its reliability.

- **Check sources and evidence:** Don’t just read the content—examine its sources and supporting evidence. For tasks that require precise answers, ask the AI for references and verify them independently.
- **Evaluate from multiple angles:** Don’t accept the AI’s single response at face value. Look at the issue from different perspectives. Sometimes an AI’s answer may be incomplete or biased due to context window limits or gaps in its data.
- **Maintain a healthy skepticism:** Don’t fully trust an answer just because it sounds reasonable. Be willing to seek additional information that supports or contradicts the AI’s claims.
- **Reflect and have an internal dialogue:** After receiving information from an AI, take time to reflect and test whether it aligns with your logic and values. Often there are multiple viable approaches; the final choice should match your needs.

In summary, independent thinking becomes even more vital in the age of AI. We must be able to assess information critically and avoid blindly following AI-generated content. By cultivating independent thinking, we can better meet the challenges AI brings and keep our thinking clear amid information overload.

Continuing to learn new things helps strengthen independent thinking: a broader knowledge base gives you better tools to evaluate information and encourages more comprehensive, nuanced thinking.
